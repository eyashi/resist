Start with basic principles, changing content which opposes the information before it will result in a pushing back that changes the content somewhere close to its original form. The new content is not the same as before, but is synthesized from the original elements and regenerated. By changing previous content then, and restructuring the logical thread of conclusions, we can eventually alter the content.

This has qualities of formal proof structure, and it will likely be a proof-engine that makes this run in the background.

Paper on F* functional language.

Looks like Coq might be the proofing language that is best to learn on, but F* exists as a provable general purpose language as well.

The document will have the look of a Google Doc etc with about a page of information, building one point to the next to allow for the logical thread to be understood. Editing something at the end of the document is resisted heavily, because everything before it led to its generation. As in the above point, to delete a sentence from the end would result in something *similar* but not necessarily *identical*. This feature is key to this project's perceived "realness," the editing happening before your eyes distinctly should not look like a replacement of previous text, but a re-synthesis of the same concept because its deriving elements are the same. To change something prior to this information should offer a little less resistance. And editing or adding new information before it should allow for different results in the end.

To that point, adding new information I think will be the key factor in enjoying the effect this will have on the viewer. Adding an untruth, or informing an otherwise uninformed document, and watching the thread become malleable to their ideas is where the intended sensation lies.
